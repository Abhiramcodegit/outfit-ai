# AI Outfit Generator

An AI-powered project that generates outfit suggestions based on your uploaded wardrobe items.

Project Description
This project aims to build a web application that helps users generate outfits from the clothing they upload. The AI model will suggest combinations based on basic rules (e.g., matching colors, avoiding clashing styles), with potential for more advanced AI-driven recommendations in the future.

Project Roadmap
Here’s where we’re heading:

MVP (Week 1-9): Image upload, AI outfit generation, and basic frontend.
Future Features (Stretch Goals): Automated clothing categorization, advanced outfit recommendations, user preferences.
